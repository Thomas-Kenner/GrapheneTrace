    Authentication Layout
    Author: SID:2412494

    Purpose: Minimal layout for login and account creation pages.

    Design Decision: No navigation, sidebar, or header components.
    Why: Reduces distractions during authentication flow, focusing user attention
    on the critical task of logging in or creating an account.

    Usage: Applied to /login and /account-creation pages via @layout directive.

    Alternative Considered: Reuse MainLayout with conditional rendering.
    Rejected because: MainLayout redirects unauthenticated users to /login,
    creating an infinite redirect loop for auth pages.
