    ADMIN SUPPORT PAGE
    ========================================
    Author: 2402513

    Purpose:
    Provides administrative support and help resources for system administrators.

    How it works:
    - Uses Blazor's @page directive to map to /admin/support route
    - Implements InteractiveServer render mode
    - Authorization attribute restricts access to Admin role only
    - Displays coming soon placeholder for support features

    Why it was done this way:
    - Consistent structure with other admin pages
    - Role-based authorization ensures only admins can access
    - Placeholder shows users that support is planned

        CONSOLIDATED ADMIN HEADER
        Author: 2402513

        Purpose:
        Unified header component for all admin pages combining branding, navigation, and user controls.
        Replaces separate headers for cleaner visual hierarchy.

        Why it was done this way:
        - Single consolidated header reduces redundancy
        - AdminHeader component handles all navigation and user profile display
        - Maintains consistent styling across all admin pages
    *@
    <AdminHeader />

            SUPPORT PLACEHOLDER CARD
            Author: 2402513

            Purpose:
            Placeholder card indicating planned support features for future development.

            How it works:
            - Static card with "coming-soon" CSS class for visual distinction
            - Informational text only, no interactive elements

            Why it was done this way:
            - Shows users that support features are planned (sets expectations)
            - "coming-soon" class applies consistent styling
            - Maintains consistent page layout for future feature additions
            - Better UX than empty space or no mention of future features
        *@
        <div class="settings-card coming-soon">
            <div class="settings-section-header">
                <h3>Support Center</h3>
                <p class="settings-description">Coming soon...</p>
            </div>
            <p style="color: var(--muted-foreground); margin: 0;">Support features will be available in a future update.</p>

        FOOTER SECTION
        Author: 2402513

        Purpose:
        Provides global navigation links (consistent across admin pages).

        How it works:
        - Simple text links with middot separators
        - Currently static placeholder

        Why it was done this way:
        - Maintains consistent footer across all admin pages
        - Standard web pattern for secondary navigation

     * Author: 2402513

     * Purpose:
     * Handle navigation tab clicks to route to other admin pages.
     *
     * How it works:
     * - Methods bound to @onclick events in navigation buttons
     * - Use NavigationManager.NavigateTo() for client-side routing
     *
     * Why it was done this way:
     * - NavigationManager provides SPA-style navigation without page reload
     * - Separate methods improve readability and testability
